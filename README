Returns the return value of the block and the time elapsed in seconds.


    use Timer;

    # Sum the recipricals of 1 to 1000, 100 times and return
    # the sum and the total execution time for the block.

    say timer { my $i = sum((1..1000) »R/» 1) for ^100; $i }

    # prints (7.485470860550344 1.5826559) (times will vary)


=head1 DESCRIPTION

A simple timer, useful to evaluate run time of a callable block without needing
to set up variables and calls to a time function.

Extremely simple and easy to implement, but I found myself writeing it over
and over when trying to refactor / optimize code, so I factored it out into a
module.
